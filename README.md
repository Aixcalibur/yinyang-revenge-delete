Curious to learn how a dialogue system or visual novels work? This Godot game demo is for you!

With fairly accessible code, it shows how you can build the foundations of a visual novel.

And most techniques, like sequencing animations or creating a text box to display dialogues and portraits also apply to most conversation systems.

This project was funded and made possible by our course [Godot 2D secrets](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses/godot-2d-secrets). If you would like to support us and get your game development skills to the next level, check our Godot courses.

We create tons of free tutorials for Godot and open-source all our code. To get more, [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NathanGDQuest)!
